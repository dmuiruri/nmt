# Overview

The main objective of this project is to train a Neural Machine
Translation model for submisstion to an ongoing [Conference on Machine
Translation
\(WMT2019\)](http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html).

A Model that achieves the highest BLEU Score is deemed to be the best
model for a particular language pair, for example all models that
perform translations from Finnish to English are comparable in
results.
